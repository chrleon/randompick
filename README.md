# randompick
Pseudo-random picker for lottery raffles.  
Sends events to Google Analytics for draws and settings.

Currently it lives on <a href="http://trekning.christianleon.com">trekning.christianleon.com</a>.

## TL;DR
I needed a way to pick 10 lottery winners from a pool of 405 lotterybooks with 50 tickets in each. This will do that. You can set the number of books per session in settings (innstillinger).

I plan to do localization with handlebars/JSON, but that is sometime in the future.
